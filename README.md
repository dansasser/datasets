==================================================

1. Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run:
   python mvlm_dataset_builder.py

- Progress bars and log messages will display in the terminal.
- The logfile (dataset_builder.log) contains a full record of every action and final summary.
- Output is saved in 'mvlm_comprehensive_dataset', formatted for direct use in training.

To expand with real scraping/fetching:
- Edit/replace 'fake_fetch_gutenberg_book_text' and add true author/book listing logic as needed.
